Issue wake turbulence cautionary advisories, e.g. "CAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE" to:
	Visual approach or visual separation behind a Heavy or B757.

What is the WT restriction for departing behind arriving heavy? Take off through flight path?

Minutes of separation: start timer when begins to roll?

General separation requirements? When to issue tfc advisory?
